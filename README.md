# MaskDetection

Mask detection is a case solution from the DSTU Autumn 2021 hackathon for "Center-invest" bank. It is a desktop application written in Python PyQT. The application integrates a convolutional neural network that is fast enough to detect face masks on humans in real time. The application also uses the face_recognition library for face recognition.
